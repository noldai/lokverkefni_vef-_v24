            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Armond Arabshahi, known by his stage name Unlike Pluto, is an American singer, songwriter, DJ and record producer. The name Unlike Pluto developed from holding onto his outcast persona. He is known for his Pluto Tapes series of albums, where he challenges himself to release one song per week starting from May 2018. Besides his Unlike Pluto project, he has a side project with Hamilton singer Joanna Jones called Why Mona where they create covers of old school classics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Originally from Atlanta and based in Los Angeles, Arabshahi describes his style of music as electronic rock.
                Arabshahi has performed at various music festivals, including Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and Euphoria Music Festival. In 2017 he also hosted a tour promoting one of his huge singles, "Everything Black".
              The success of the Pluto Tapes lead to Armond releasing songs weekly afterwards, from 2020, 2021, and 2022. In 2022 he plans to release 50 songs for the year.
            </p>
            <h2>Why Mona</h2>
            <p>
              In 2017, Arabshahi announced a new side project called Why Mona with Hamilton singer Joanna Jones. The pair released a cover of Queen's "We Will Rock You" the same day. Why Mona combines rock and electronic music to create covers of old school classics. In contrast to Unlike Pluto's electronic driven production, Joanna hails from Broadway where she's currently starring in the roles of Maria Reynolds and Peggy Schuyler in the critically acclaimed Broadway hit musical Hamilton. In early 2019, the duo's cover of "Wannabe" by Spice Girls went viral on TikTok amassing over 10 million unique video creations by users on the platform. In 2021 Dell computers released an ad that featured their track "Rabbit Hole" which introduced a lot of viewers to this song and group.

              Like Saturn

              In 2020, Arabshahi began another side project called Like Saturn, where he makes lofi chill beats to represent a moment in time.

                <p>
                    Two lies, back to back<br>
                    Two years, now it's past (Now it's past)<br>
                    Two fears, come to pass<br>
                    Too near, this can't last (This can't last)<br><br>

                    Broken glass is covering the floor now<br>
                    The bottles I poured out<br>
                    Tried to purge myself of everything about you<br>
                    But when you always show up on my doorstep<br>
                    Oh-oh-oh<br><br>

                    Choking on your every word, your every desire<br>
                    While I gasp for air, you just stand and stare<br>
                    Choking on you like nicotine, my lungs are on fire<br>
                    But I won't die today 'cause you will kill me slowly<br><br>

                    I don't wanna feel like something's wrong (But something is)<br>
                    Yeah, I don't wanna blindly just move on (But you know you will)<br>
                    When I'm wasting daylight sleeping on the west side<br>
                    Maybe I can stop time, I know<br>
                    Know that you, know that you won't<br><br>

                    I know that I can't seem to move on<br>
                    (Don't move on, don't move on)<br>
                    And free myself from you<br>
                    (Don't move on, oh)<br><br>

                    Choking on your every word, your every desire<br>
                    While I gasp for air, you just stand and stare<br>
                    Choking on you like nicotine, my lungs are on fire<br>
                    But I won't die today 'cause you will kill me slowly<br><br>

                    Words are creeping in, they're not mine (You will do what I say)<br>
                    Maybe I am losing my mind (You will do what I think)<br>
                    Maybe I am hanging by your strings (You're gonna move with me)<br>
                    I, you are alone with me<br><br>

                    I know that I can't seem to move on<br>
                    (Don't move on, don't move on)<br>
                    And free myself from you<br>
                    (Don't move on, oh)<br><br>

                    Choking on your every word, your every desire, yeah<br>
                    While I gasp for air, you just stand and stare<br>
                    Choking on you like nicotine, my lungs are on fire<br>
                    But I won't die today 'cause you will kill me slowly<br>

                    Taking all the starlight from me now<br>
                    Turning all my spotlight into dark nights<br>
                    Stolen from me now<br>
                    Taking all my starlight<br>

                    Stolen from me now<br>
                    Turning all my starlight into dark nights<br><br>

                    And I don't want a heart attack<br>
                    I fear the worst is coming down, down on me<br>
                    And I can't take this on my chest, I know I'm not my best<br>
                    Rock bottom doesn't, doesn't pay rent<br>
                    I can't go and throw this all away, a stain on my name<br>
                    Not turning a, turning away<br>
                    Thought you were invested into me<br>
                    A fool's paradise, look who paid the price<br><br>

                    Ooh no, no (Hey)<br>

                    Turning all my starlight into dark nights<br><br>

                    Dreams are nightmares in a haunted mind<br>
                    I was left behind, can't wake my cloudy eyes<br>
                    And oh, how the times have changed<br>
                    As the seconds tick away, my life becomes detained<br>
                    And I can’t go and throw this all away, a stain on my name<br>
                    Not turning a, turning away<br>

                    You can't change a mind that’s made, a bruise won’t fade<br>
                    I know you’ll pray that I’ll just go away (I’ll go away)<br>
                    Maybe I’ll just go away (I’m gone today)<br>
